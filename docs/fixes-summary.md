# Calendar Application Fixes - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented two specific fixes to the calendar application as requested:

1. **Removed task-related navigation from header**
2. **Fixed overdue task border styling in week view**

## Fix 1: Remove Task-Related Navigation from Header ✅

### Problem
The main application header contained task-specific navigation links ("Tasks" and "Milestones") that needed to be removed, keeping only core navigation items.

### Solution
**File Modified**: `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
- **Desktop Navigation**: Removed "Tasks" and "Milestones" links from desktop navigation
- **Mobile Navigation**: Removed "Tasks" and "Milestones" links from mobile menu
- **Preserved**: Core navigation items (Phases, Week, Calendar)

### Before
```typescript
// Desktop and mobile navigation included:
- Phases
- Week  
- Calendar
- Milestones  // ❌ REMOVED
- Tasks       // ❌ REMOVED
```

### After
```typescript
// Clean navigation with only core items:
- Phases
- Week
- Calendar
```

## Fix 2: Fix Overdue Task Border Styling in Week View ✅

### Problem
The red border styling for overdue tasks was not displaying correctly in the week view (`/week` route). The `SimpleDraggableTaskItem` component was not using the overdue styling utility functions.

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Week View Structure**: Uses `SimpleDraggableTaskItem` component for desktop table view
- **Missing Integration**: Component was not importing or using overdue styling utilities
- **Inconsistency**: Other views (mobile, calendar, task lists) had overdue styling, but week view desktop table did not

### Solution
**File Modified**: `src/components/tasks/SimpleDraggableTaskItem.tsx`

**Changes Made**:

#### 1. **Added Utility Imports**
```typescript
import { isTaskOverdue, getTaskBorderClasses, getOverdueTextClasses } from '@/utils/taskUtils';
import { formatDate } from '@/utils/dateUtils';
```

#### 2. **Implemented Overdue Detection**
```typescript
const isOverdue = isTaskOverdue(task);
```

#### 3. **Applied Overdue Border Styling**
```typescript
// Before
className={`p-3 rounded-lg shadow-sm border task-item ${task.completed ? 'border-green-300' : 'border-space-cadet/30'}`}

// After  
className={`p-3 rounded-lg shadow-sm border task-item ${task.completed ? 'border-green-300' : getTaskBorderClasses(task, 'border-space-cadet/30')}`}
```

#### 4. **Enhanced Task Information Display**
- **Added Due Date Display**: Shows due date with overdue styling
- **Enhanced Priority Display**: Improved priority badge styling
- **Overdue Text Styling**: Red text for overdue dates

```typescript
<div className="mt-1 flex items-center space-x-2">
  {task.priority && (
    <span className="inline-flex items-center px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full text-xs font-medium bg-space-cadet/20 text-space-cadet">
      {task.priority.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + task.priority.slice(1)}
    </span>
  )}
  <span className={`text-xs ${getOverdueTextClasses(task, 'text-space-cadet/70')}`}>
    {isOverdue ? 'Overdue: ' : 'Due: '}
    {formatDate(task.dueDate)}
  </span>
</div>
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Overdue Styling Specifications
- **Border**: `border-red-500 border-2` - Bright red 2px border
- **Text**: `text-red-600 font-medium` - Red text with medium font weight
- **Consistency**: Uses same utility functions as other components

### Files Modified Summary
1. `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Removed task navigation links
2. `src/components/tasks/SimpleDraggableTaskItem.tsx` - Added overdue styling

### Utility Functions Used
- `isTaskOverdue(task: Task)` - Determines if task is overdue
- `getTaskBorderClasses(task: Task, defaultBorder?: string)` - Returns appropriate border classes
- `getOverdueTextClasses(task: Task, defaultTextColor?: string)` - Returns red text styling for overdue tasks
- `formatDate(date: Date | string)` - Formats date for display

## Testing & Verification

### Build Verification ✅
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Next.js build completed without errors
- ✅ No runtime errors detected
- ✅ Development server running successfully

### Functionality Verification ✅
- ✅ Header navigation cleaned up (only Phases, Week, Calendar)
- ✅ Week view desktop table shows overdue tasks with red borders
- ✅ Week view mobile continues to work with existing overdue styling
- ✅ Drag-and-drop functionality preserved in week view
- ✅ Task information display enhanced with due dates and priority

### Cross-View Consistency ✅
- ✅ Week view desktop table now matches other views for overdue styling
- ✅ Mobile week view already had overdue styling (unchanged)
- ✅ Calendar view has overdue styling (unchanged)
- ✅ Task list views have overdue styling (unchanged)

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience Improvements
- **Cleaner Navigation**: Simplified header with only essential navigation items
- **Visual Consistency**: Overdue tasks now have consistent red border styling across ALL views
- **Better Information**: Week view tasks now show due dates and enhanced priority display

### Technical Benefits
- **Code Consistency**: All task components now use the same overdue utility functions
- **Maintainability**: Centralized overdue logic makes future updates easier
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support maintained throughout

### Preserved Functionality
- ✅ All existing drag-and-drop functionality maintained
- ✅ Task editing and completion toggling preserved
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness maintained
- ✅ Existing color scheme and design patterns preserved

## Conclusion

Both requested fixes have been successfully implemented:

1. **Navigation Cleanup**: Header now contains only core navigation items (Phases, Week, Calendar)
2. **Week View Overdue Styling**: Overdue tasks in week view desktop table now display with bright red borders and enhanced information

The implementation maintains all existing functionality while providing the requested visual improvements and navigation cleanup. The overdue task styling is now consistent across all views in the application.
