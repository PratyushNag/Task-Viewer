# Project Requirements Document: Calendar View Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Calendar View application. This application is a simple, frontend-only web tool that provides users with a clear and interactive interface to manage their tasks and milestones. It serves as a visual aid and organizational tool, allowing users to input, view, and track their commitments through different calendar views. The application will store all data locally in the browser, requiring no backend server or database.

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Product Goals

* To provide a user-friendly frontend application for manual study task and milestone management.
* To offer clear visualizations of tasks and deadlines through a calendar and specific views (day, week, milestones).
* To enable users to track their progress on milestones using visual indicators (color coding).
* To create a simple, intuitive interface for adding and updating academic tasks and milestones.

### 2.2 User Goals

* Users can easily add, edit, and delete their study tasks.
* Users can organize tasks by date and priority.
* Users can see a clear overview of their upcoming tasks for the day and week.
* Users can view their entire academic schedule on a calendar.
* Users can define and track important academic milestones (e.g., assignment deadlines, exam dates).
* Users can quickly see which milestones are overdue or upcoming through color coding and a dedicated view.
* Users can get a visual representation of their workload over time.

## 3. User Stories

* As a student, I want to add a new study task with a title, description, and due date.
* As a student, I want to add an academic milestone with a name and deadline.
* As a student, I want to see a list of all tasks I need to complete today.
* As a student, I want to see a list of all tasks I need to complete this week.
* As a student, I want to view all my tasks and milestones on a monthly calendar.
* As a student, I want to mark a task as completed.
* As a student, I want to see milestones color-coded on the calendar and in a list based on their proximity to the deadline or if they are overdue.
* **As a student, I want to see a dedicated list of all my academic milestones, sorted by date, to quickly see what is approaching.**
* As a student, I want to edit the details of an existing task or milestone.
* As a student, I want to delete a task or milestone.
* As a student, I want to see a summary or visualization of my tasks and milestones.
* As a student, I want the application to remember my tasks and milestones when I revisit it (using local storage or simple data import/export).

## 4. Features

* **Task Management:**
  * Add New Task (Title, Description, Due Date, Optional Priority).
  * Edit Existing Task.
  * Delete Task.
  * Mark Task as Complete/Incomplete.
* **Milestone Management:**
  * Add New Milestone (Name, Deadline).
  * Edit Existing Milestone.
  * Delete Milestone.
  * **Color Coding for Milestones:**
    * Green: Deadline is in the future (configurable threshold, e.g., > 7 days away).
    * Yellow: Deadline is approaching (configurable threshold, e.g., within the next 7 days).
    * Red: Deadline is today or overdue.
* **Views:**
  * **Today View:** List of tasks due today, potentially with overdue tasks highlighted.
  * **Week View:** List of tasks due within the next 7 days.
  * **Calendar View:** Interactive monthly calendar displaying tasks and milestones on their respective dates. Clicking on a date could show details.
  * **Milestone View:** A dedicated list displaying all created milestones, sorted chronologically by deadline. Milestones should show their deadline date and utilize the same color-coding as the calendar view to indicate status (approaching, overdue).
* **Data Representation/Overview:**
  * A simple dashboard or section providing an overview, e.g., number of tasks due today/this week, upcoming milestones.
  * Visual representation on the calendar (dots, bars, or brief text).
* **Data Storage:**
  * **Local Browser Storage:** Store task and milestone data directly in the user's browser's local storage. This means data is tied to the specific browser and device.
  * **(Optional Future Consideration):** Simple Import/Export functionality (e.g., JSON or CSV) to allow users to back up/transfer their data.

## 5. Scope

### 5.1 In Scope for the Initial Version

* **Application Type:** Single-page frontend web application.
* **Core Functionality:** Adding, editing, deleting, and marking complete tasks; adding, editing, and deleting milestones.
* **Views:** Today view, Week view, Monthly Calendar view, **Milestone View**.
* **Milestone Visualization:** Color coding based on deadline proximity/status in both Calendar and Milestone Views.
* **Data Storage:** Local browser storage.
* **Hosting:** Deployment on Vercel.
* **User Interaction:** Manual data input and updates only.

### 5.2 Out of Scope for the Initial Version

* **Backend Development:** No server-side code for user accounts, data storage, or processing.
* **User Authentication/Accounts:** No login or user profiles across devices. Data is local to the browser.
* **Automated Planning:** No AI or algorithmic generation of study plans or tasks from syllabi or other inputs.
* **External Integrations:** No searching for external resources (past papers, etc.).
* **Collaboration Features:** No sharing of tasks or calendars between users.
* **Push Notifications or Reminders:** Relies on the user checking the application.
* **Syncing Across Devices:** Due to local storage.
* **Complex Reporting or Analytics:** Simple overview and milestone list only.
* **Support for Multiple Users on a Single Instance:** Designed for individual use.

## 6. Non-Goals

* To be a full-fledged Learning Management System (LMS).
* To replace traditional calendar applications with complex scheduling features.
* To automatically find or suggest study materials.
* To provide AI-driven insights or recommendations.

## 7. Metrics for Success

* Number of deployments on Vercel (indicating interest/usage, though not unique users).
* (If possible via analytics) Number of active sessions or pages viewed.
* Positive feedback from users regarding usability and usefulness for manual planning and milestone tracking.
* Number of tasks and milestones manually added and managed (if this can be tracked anonymously and aggregated).

## 8. Design and User Experience (UX)

The application should prioritize a clean, intuitive, and responsive design. The calendar, task views, and the new **Milestone View** should be easy to read and navigate. Adding and editing tasks/milestones should be a quick and simple process. Color coding for milestones should be clear and easily distinguishable across all relevant views. The overall user journey should feel lightweight and efficient for manual data entry and visualization. There should be clear navigation between the different views (Today, Week, Calendar, Milestones).

## 9. Technical Considerations

* **Frontend Framework:** React with Next.js for a modern, optimized frontend application
* **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
* **UI Framework:** Tailwind CSS for styling
* **State Management:** React Context API for simple state management
* **Data Structure:** JSON objects to represent tasks and milestones stored in localStorage
* **Calendar Component:** React Big Calendar or FullCalendar for the calendar view
* **Local Storage:** Browser's localStorage API for data persistence
* **Hosting:** Vercel for deployment and hosting

## 10. Assumptions

* Users are comfortable with manually adding and managing their study tasks and milestones.
* The amount of data a single user will input will not exceed the practical limits of browser local storage.
* Users understand that data stored locally is tied to their browser and device.
* Users have a modern web browser to access the application.

## 11. Future Considerations

* Simple data import and export functionality.
* Basic data visualization charts (e.g., tasks completed over time).
* Option for different calendar views (week starting on a different day, agenda view).
* More customizable color-coding options for milestones or tasks.
* Integration with browser notifications for deadlines (requires user permission).
* Ability to link tasks to specific milestones.
